# ðŸ“… Random Date Generator

A repository of a layered design object-oriented date generator with a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random uniform distribution to randomly generate dates as:

 1) Requests the user for a positive non-zero integer, in order to produce that many 
	random dates ranging from 0 CE to 9999 CE. Built-in error checking keeps prodding 
	the user for a correct input, in case of faulty input.
	
 2) Then utilizing the Date object a for loop constructs the desired amount of dates 
	along with name of the month and whether the constructed year is a leap year or not.
